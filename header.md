# SSB Rooms 2.0

A redesign of [room servers](https://github.com/staltz/ssb-room) with [user aliases](docs/Alias/Readme.md) and [better privacy](docs/Setup/Privacy%20modes.md). A room server is an SSB peer with privileged internet presence (not behind NATs) that allows its clients to perform [tunneled connections](docs/Participation/Tunneled%20connection.md) with [tunnel addresses](docs/Participation/Tunnel%20addresses.md).
