## Invites

When [joining](Joining.md) a *Community* room or *Restricted* room, [internal users](../Stakeholders/Internal%20user.md) create invites. An invite can be sent to anyone who is not yet an internal user, and who can then "claim" the invite in order to become a new internal user of the room.

A room server **SHOULD** employ [SSB HTTP Invites](https://ssb-ngi-pointer.github.io/ssb-http-invite-spec/).
