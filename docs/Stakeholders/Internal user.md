## Internal user

SSB user who accesses the room server and is considered *internal* because they have already [joined](../Participation/Joining.md) the room and may even have registered an [alias](../Alias/Readme.md) in the room.

### Specification

**Definition:** an *internal user* of a room is any SSB ID for which the room grants a [tunnel address](../Participation/Tunnel%20addresses.md). In other words, if an SSB ID is *reachable* via a [tunneled connection](../Participation/Tunneled%20connection.md) through a room server, then they are considered an internal user of that room.

**Becoming an internal user:** read more about that in [Joining a room](../Participation/Joining.md).
