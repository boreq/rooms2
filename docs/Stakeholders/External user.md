# External user

Any SSB user who is not an [internal user](Internal%20user.md) of the room (i.e. do not have a usable tunnel address referencing the room), but may still interact with the room server in meaningful ways, such as doing [tunneled connections](../Room/Tunneled%20connection.md) or [alias resolution](../Alias/Resolution.md).
