## Room admin

Person or organization responsible for operating the room server, and has full access rights over the server's resources such as logs, disk, memory, etc. In other words, this person or organization physically owns the room server or has SSH access to the remote server hosted in some PaaS cloud provider.

Typically, the admin possesses an SSB ID (it's very common, but not necessarily always the case), and is also a [moderator](Moderator.md) in the room.
